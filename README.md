# HDCSCodingEvening2022Q1
> A fun night of coding. It's an event where you can network with alumni and your peers, show off your coding finesse and take on a real-world coding challenge with your peers.

### 1. Bitmap Image Conversion
Write a function that converts a bitmap image of a digital clock (represented as a string of the form: hh:mm) into its representational bit string. A bitmap image is a by-product of parsing bits (0's and 1's) from a canvas which is basically an image in black on a white background, where 0 represents the white background and 1 represents the black pixel (it's what an image is composed of, technically). The general idea of this challenge is to encode a bitstring that reflects the image of a digital clock (of this format: hh:mm). The images below are basic examples of how these are conceived.
